Something that will resonate with many people today.\"\n\nWW2 veteran Sir Tom Moore, who raised more than \u00a332m for NHS charities during the height of the coronavirus pandemic in April, said: \"I really thought Vera Lynn would live longer, she's been speaking so well on TV recently. She had a huge impact on me in Burma and remained important to me throughout my life.\"\n\nIn 1940, at the height of the London Blitz, Vera Lynn would set off to the BBC's underground studios at the Criterion Theatre in central London.\n\nThe 15-minute show was called Starlight and was broadcast at 2:30am to soldiers around the world.\n\nAt the time, the BBC was being criticised in Parliament for broadcasting slushy, sentimental songs. A number of MPs felt there needed to be more upbeat songs to boost morale.\n\nHer popularity even surprised the BBC, this was after all a little overseas show broadcast in the middle of the night.\n\nVera Lynn sang the songs that resonated emotionally with people who were separated from their loved ones and she sang them directly to you.\n\nIt was warm, intimate, heartfelt and personal, and that's why Vera Lynn became the \"Forces' Sweetheart\".\n\nSinger Katherine Jenkins, who performed Dame Vera's wartime classics for the VE Day anniversary last month, said: \"I simply cannot find the words to explain just how much I adored this wonderful lady.\n\n\"Her voice brought comfort to millions in their darkest hours, her songs filled the nation's hearts with hope, and her emotive performances, whether home or abroad, then or now, helped to get us through.\"\n\nIn a photo tribute on Twitter, Clarence House posted pictures of Dame Vera meeting the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nThe Royal British Legion described her as \"an unforgettable British icon\" and a \"symbol of hope to the Armed Forces community past and present\".\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said she was a \"hero\" who captured the \"sense of longing felt by so many during our darkest hour\", while Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said she \"lifted our nation and its Armed Forces in their moment of maximum peril\"."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53093127", "published": "2020-06-18T12:41:42", "title": "Coronavirus: Bank pumps \u00a3100bn into UK economy to aid recovery", "text": "Image copyright PA Media\n\nThe Bank of England will pump an extra \u00a3100bn into the UK economy to help fight the \"unprecedented\" coronavirus-induced downturn.\n\nBank policymakers voted 8-1 to increase the size of its bond-buying programme.\n\nHowever, they said there was growing evidence that the hit to the economy would be \"less severe\" than initially feared.\n\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) also kept interest rates at a record low of 0.1%.\n\nThe move comes just days after Bank governor Andrew Bailey said policymakers were ready to take action after the economy suffered its biggest monthly contraction on record.\n\nThe UK economy shrank by 20.4% in April, while official jobs data showed the number of workers on UK payrolls fell by more than 600,000 between March and May.\n\nThe Bank said more recent indicators suggested the economy was starting to bounce back.\n\nMinutes from the MPC's June meeting said: \"Payments data are consistent with a recovery in consumer spending in May and June, and housing activity has started to pick up recently.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Bailey warned that the outlook for the economy remained uncertain. He said: \"We don't want to get too carried away by this. Let's be clear, we're still living in very unusual times.\"\n\nThe minutes added: \"While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer-lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic.\"\n\nBack in May, policymakers warned the economy was heading for its sharpest recession on record.\n\nScenarios drawn up by the Bank suggested the economy could shrink by 25% in the three months to June.\n\nHowever, the MPC said more recent evidence suggested the contraction would be less severe.\n\nThe extra monetary stimulus - known as quantitative easing (QE) - will raise the total size of the Bank's asset purchase programme to \u00a3745bn.\n\nPolicymakers said the injection would help to support financial markets and underpin the recovery.\n\nHowever, Andy Haldane, the Bank's chief economist, voted against the increase.\n\nHe said the recovery was happening \"sooner and materially faster\" than the Bank expected in May.\n\nSlow recovery\n\nPolicymakers said the jobs market was likely to remain weak for some time, with a risk of \"higher and more persistent unemployment\".\n\nMillions of workers have already seen their pay packets shrink as a result of lower pay for furloughed employees. A survey by the Bank said other companies had postponed or cancelled pay rises this year.\n\nMr Bailey said: \"Even with the relaxation of some Covid-related restrictions on economic activity, a degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is likely to persist. The economy, and especially the labour market, will therefore take some time to recover towards its previous path.\"\n\nWeak inflation\n\nMr Bailey also addressed the recent fall in UK inflation in an open letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\n\nInflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), fell to 0.5% in May, from 0.8% in April - well below the Bank of England's 2% target.\n\nMr Bailey said weak inflation had been by driven by falling oil and energy prices, as well as a global drop in economic activity.\n\nThe Bank expects inflation to return to target within two years.\n\nThe Bank of England has increased its support for the economy, despite it assessing that the outlook is not quite as awful as its scenario last month. The economy is on course for a hit in the second quarter of about 20% compared with the final three months of 2019. That's still historic, and off the scale, but not quite as extreme as the 27% it predicted in May.\n\nThe extra \u00a3100bn of purchases of government bonds also has the air of an insurance policy.\n\nMost of the MPC were concerned about a couple of factors, A less awful outlook does not mean the recovery will be quick. This is for two reasons stretching beyond economics.\n\nThere is a fear that the \"prevalence of the virus\" in the UK will mean that Britons will continue to socially distance, voluntarily, holding back the recovery more than other nations (Germany would be an example).\n\nRelated to that was the idea that more QE now could mitigate the economic impact of \"higher rates of Covid-19 infection going forward\" - a second wave.\n\nSo the news is still bad, but less awful. But risks beyond the purely economic led to more billions being injected into the economy."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-53083995", "published": "2020-06-18T13:05:42", "title": "Coronavirus: Shops in Scotland to reopen from 29 June", "text": "Image caption Non-essential shops in Scotland have been closed since the lockdown was imposed on 23 March\n\nMost shops in Scotland are to reopen from 29 June as part of a further easing of the country's lockdown rules.\n\nThe changes will also see anyone who lives on their own - or only with children - to form an \"extended group\" with one other household from tomorrow.\n\nPeople will also be able meet outdoors with two other households at the same time rather than just one.\n\nFace coverings are to be made compulsory for everyone using public transport from Monday.\n\nAnd people who have previously been told to shield during the lockdown because they are at high risk are now able to meet other people outside for the first time.\n\nNo decision has yet been made on when pubs, restaurants or beer gardens will be able to reopen.\n\nThe announcement by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon means the country has now moved to the second phase of its four-phase \"route map\" aimed at ending the lockdown while continuing to suppress the virus.\n\nBut Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw called for \"much more ambition\", saying everything Ms Sturgeon had announced had already happened in England two weeks ago.\n\nAnd he claimed Ms Sturgeon \"simply doesn't understand or comprehend the depth of the economic crisis we're about to go through\".\n\nThe Scottish government has generally been taking a more cautious approach to opening up the economy again than the UK government has in England, where shops were able to reopen earlier this month.\n\nMs Sturgeon is concerned that moving too quickly will risk a resurgence of the virus that has already been linked to the deaths of more than 4,000 people in Scotland.\n\nShe said she understood the desire of all businesses to reopen quickly, but it was vital that they do so \"safely and in a way that is consistent with continued suppression of the virus\".\n\nImage caption Nicola Sturgeon has been accused by some political opponents and businesses of being too cautious in easing the lockdown\n\nHer announcement means that shops of all sizes will be able to open from 29 June long as they have outdoor entrances and exits - so indoor shopping centres will remain closed except for essential retailers such as supermarkets and pharmacists.\n\nMs Sturgeon said retailers should now start to put plans in place to ensure that customers and staff are able to keep the required 2m apart.\n\nShe added: \"Of course, all of us as customers have a role to play.

Some police officers have also done so at protests, and Premier League footballers and officials took the knee on Wednesday before the first games since the pause in the season caused by coronavirus.\n\nSpeaking to talkRadio on Thursday, Raab was asked whether he would adopt the pose.

But I understand people feel differently about it, so it\u2019s a matter of personal choice.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear why Raab believed the pose came from Game of Thrones, the popular TV fantasy series.\n\nIt began in 2016 when Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, opted to sit on the team bench rather than stand for the pre-NFL game rendition of the US national anthem, in protest against racism and police brutality.\n\nKaepernick, who was joined by other players, later decided to pose on one knee, saying this made the same point while showing more respect to military veterans. Among those he took advice from was Nate Boyer, a former Green Beret who also played in the NFL.\n\nKaepernick\u2019s actions led him to be frozen out of professional sport, and he was criticised by Donald Trump and others. He could now return to the NFL, with even Trump saying this would not be a problem for him.\n\nAsked whether he would take the knee to show solidarity with BLM, Raab said he would not, adding: \u201cI\u2019d take the knee for two people: the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me.\u201d\n\nOn the subject of his wife he added: \u201cBy the way, she disputes that.

But I\u2019m certain I did.\u201d\n\nRaab\u2019s comments prompted derision from some Labour MPs.

And on the streets, what started as Black Lives Matter protests have morphed into a movement for racial justice amid growing recognition that systemic racism denies people of colour equal access to economic, social, environmental and climate justice, as well as health equity, political power, civil rights and human rights.\n\n\u201cThe disproportionate rates of [Covid-19] infection, hospitalisation and deaths are linked to lingering and persistent health, social, economic and environmental inequities facing black Americans, conditions which are rooted in oppression, discrimination, medical apartheid and structural racism \u2026 and which today have created a perfect storm,\u201d said Peggy Shepard, co-founder of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, at a press conference this week.\n\nIn the US and the UK, research has found that people of colour suffer more air pollution than white residents. Poor air quality, which is linked to multiple respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, significantly increases the risk of death from Covid-19.\n\nAs the crowds have grown, so have demands for radical reforms.\n\n\u201cRacism is built into America\u2019s DNA, and since 1619, black Americans have had to endure this violent and oppressive system \u2026 Covid 19 exposed our nation\u2019s racial divide,\u201d said Robert Bullard, distinguished professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University and co-chair of the National Black Environmental Justice Network (NBEJN).\n\nThe NBEJN, an organisation founded in 1999 to address the environmental racism faced by black communities across the US, this week relaunched with a pledge to create a roadmap for a broad environmental justice agenda viewed through a racial justice lens.\n\n\u201cEnvironmental racism kills, air pollution and rollbacks to environmental protections and regulations make it hard for black people to breathe. At NBEJN we are connecting the dots,\u201d said Bullard.\n\nGlobally, the environmental and climate movement has long faced criticisms of failing to understand the crucial role of racial justice in terms of both impact and solutions.\n\nIn the US, the environmental justice movement emerged in the 1980s in part because neither white-dominated environmental groups nor civil rights groups considered the disproportionate dumping of toxic waste in black neighbourhoods as part of their agenda.\n\nThe birth of the movement was cemented in 1991 at the first national people of colour environmental leadership summit attended by academics and leaders from black, Latino, Native American and Asian American communities, including Robert Bullard, who drafted 17 principles of environmental justice.\n\nRosamund Kissi-Debrah has campaigned for greater awareness and tighter pollution control since the death of her nine-year-old daughter, Ella, in London from a rare form of asthma. Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian\n\nThe UK has lagged behind. But widespread protests in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement have also evolved into a reckoning with Britain\u2019s racist past and present - including within the environmental movement.\n\nRosamund Kissi-Debrah is a World Health Organization advocate for health and air quality who has campaigned for greater awareness and tighter pollution control since the death of her nine-year-old daughter, Ella, in London from a rare form of asthma. She was one of many critics of a Public Health England review that failed to consider air pollution as a factor in the higher rates of coronavirus deaths among BAME groups.\n\nKissi-Debrah said many BAME activists feel they are not given the same platform and access to resources. \u201cI think I have to work harder. I\u2019m not resentful. That\u2019s the way it is. Should it be that way? Probably not,\u201d she said\n\nIncome inequality and job insecurity also play a part. Kissi-Debrah says black people in the UK are less affluent than other ethnic groups, and less likely to be able to spare time for meetings, protests or lobbying actions.\n\nMadhu Krishnan, professor of African, world and comparative literatures at the University of Bristol and a climate movement supporter, said there were a large number of black climate activists in her city, particularly in Extinction Rebellion, but there was still a perception that it was mainly white and middle class.\n\n\u201cIf you look globally at what happened to climate, a disproportionate amount of blame does need to go to the global north, especially the former colonial powers. Environmental reparations are owed,\u201d said Krishnan. \u201cAnd more thought needs to be given to solutions. The idea of carbon offsets simply reinscribes colonial frameworks.\u201d\n\nDaze Aghaji agrees that new groups like Extinction Rebellion are more inclusive and open to change than traditional organisations like Greenpeace.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks, the protest movement is really helping. People are more open to listen. It made people realise the US is not the only country with a systematic problem of racism,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a moment to really think how we relate to one another... The toxic system is something that we all have to live with.\u201d\n\nAs protesters and activists demand world leaders also connect the dots, in a video message posted on Twitter, Ayana Johnson, a New York-based oceanographer and founder of the Ocean Collective, a not-for-profit organisation rooted in social justice, succinctly linked racial justice to climate justice.\n\n\u201cTo the white people who care about maintaining a habitable planet, I need you to be actively anti-racist. I need you to understand that our inequality crisis is intertwined with the climate crisis. If we don\u2019t work on both, we will succeed at neither.\u201d"}]}, "breitbart": {"link": "http://www.breitbart.com/", "articles": [{"title": "Supreme Court Rejects Trump Admin\u2019s Rescinding of DACA", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to end legal protections for 650,000 young immigrants, a stunning rebuke to the president in the midst of his reelection campaign.\n\nFor now, those immigrants retain their protection from deportation and their authorization to work in the United States.\n\nThe outcome seems certain to elevate the issue in Trump\u2019s campaign, given the anti-immigrant rhetoric of his first presidential run in 2016 and immigration restrictions his administration has imposed since then.\n\nThe justices rejected administration arguments that the 8-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program is illegal and that courts have no role to play in reviewing the decision to end DACA.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court that the administration did not pursue the end of the program properly.\n\n\u201cWe do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies,\u201c Roberts wrote. \u201cWe address only whether the agency complied with the procedural requirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its action.

I think that is \u2014 it\u2019s just a ridiculous statement,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we saw in the video that the \u2014 Brooks was engaged in a fight with the officers, they were on the ground. We know that when we\u2019re on the ground, we have a very high likelihood of being hurt or killed. It\u2019s not the place we want to be. This is not a wrestling match. Brooks is able to take a nonlethal weapon, a taser, away from one of the officers, and he flees, they give chase. He\u2019s committed two felony obstruction of an officer counts, and he needs to be held accountable. So they were perfectly justified in running behind Brooks to capture him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe \u2014 Brooks turned back to the officers, and fired the taser,\u201d Sheriff Williams continued. \u201cAnd we all know \u2014 this is the third law enforcement agency I\u2019ve been head of, and every agency I\u2019ve gone to, I\u2019ve required every officer who carries a taser, to be tased with it so that you understand the incapacitation. Five seconds: one thousand-one, one thousand-two, one thousand-three, one thousand-four, one thousand-five. That\u2019s five whole seconds that, if an officer is hit with that taser, that he \u2014 all of his muscles will be locked up and he\u2019ll have the inability to move and to respond. And yet he is still responsible for every weapon on his belt. He \u2014 so if that officer had been hit, he still has a firearm on his side. And the likelihood of him being stomped in the head or having his firearm taken and used against him was a probability. And so he did what he needed to do, and this was a completely justified shooting.\u201d\n\nKeilar asked if Williams saw the force as necessary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very necessary,\u201d the sheriff replied. \u201cThe Fourth Amendment allows it. This is the objective reasonableness standard, and there\u2019s nothing malicious or sadistic in the way these officers behaved. And it\u2019s very unfortunate that the law enforcement leaders in the state of Georgia have not come out and stood together on this case. I think it\u2019s political and it\u2019s senseless. We\u2019re sending the wrong message to our black youth, we\u2019re telling them that it\u2019s OK, that they can run from the police, they can take a weapon from the police, they can fight with the police. And point a weapon at the police, and expect nothing to happen. That is the wrong message to send to black youth.\u201d\n\nThe Burke County Sheriff said the circumstances were much different from the Ahmaud Arbery case.\n\n\u201cNow, we cannot \u2014 we cannot, Brianna, put this case with the Ahmaud Arbery case, nor the George Floyd case,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen I saw the George Floyd case, I was outraged,\u201d he added. \u201cTwo weeks ago, I was so outraged that I wrote a letter to the governor, the head of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, and the head of the Georgia Sheriffs\u2019 Association, and I provided them with seven standards that I think are very necessary to prevent black men from being killed at the hands of police in the way it was done in the Floyd case and the Ahmaud Arbery case.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/06/18/burke-county-ga-sheriff-on-atlanta-police-shooting-nothing-malicious-or-sadistic-in-the-way-these-officers-behaved/", "published": "2020-06-18T00:00:00"}]}, "infowars": {"link": "https://www.infowars.com/", "articles": [{"title": "\u201cI\u2019m Scared\u201d: Seattle Residents Living Near CHOP Frightened For Their Safety", "text": "Numerous Seattle residents living near the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone (CHOP) that has been taken over by Black Lives Matter demonstrators say they are scared and fear for their safety.\n\nSpeaking with local news station King 5, one man said that he and his fiancee, who live near Cal Anderson Park, which has been occupied by protesters for two weeks, were living in fear.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not even here most of the time.

The administration could try again to shut it down by offering a more detailed explanation for its action, but the White House might not want to end such a popular program in the heat of a presidential campaign.\n\nRoberts was joined in the majority by liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nLet our news meet your inbox.

The Association of American Medical Colleges told the court last fall \u2014 well before the pandemic crisis \u2014 that the U.S. is unprepared \"to fill the loss that would result if DACA recipients were excluded from the health care workforce.\"\n\nThe court said the Department of Homeland Security did not act properly when it ordered the program ended in 2017. In response to legal challenges, lower court rulings allowed DACA to keep going, letting young people in the program to reapply every two years and remain under its protection. Children of illegal immigrants were allowed to remain here if they were under 16 when their parents brought them to the U.S. and if they arrived by 2007.\n\nDACA's defenders had argued that federal law required the Trump administration to give a detailed explanation before trying to shut the program down \u2014 an action that would affect hundreds of thousands of people and the businesses that employ them. Instead, they said, the government simply declared the program illegal. More than 100 business groups, including Apple and Microsoft, sought to preserve DACA, arguing many of their employees are part of the program.\n\nFigures show that over 90 percent of DACA participants have a job. Nearly half are in school.

Tang told officials that he had not left the city in more than two weeks and had not been in contact with anyone outside the city.\n\nAD\n\nAuthorities soon discovered dozens more cases, mostly linked to a sprawling market in Beijing\u2019s southeast. On Saturday, it reimposed strict \u201cwartime\u201d measures to prevent a second wave of infections. Residents, taken aback by a partial lockdown in the city, described something akin to deja vu.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTwo months of things loosening up, and life feeling like it\u2019s going to be normal, and all of a sudden we\u2019re back to where we were in February,\u201d Nelson Quan, restricted to a compound in the Yuquan district, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe number of cases remains small for a city of 22 million. But authorities are taking few chances: 1,200 flights in and out of Beijing\u2019s two airports were canceled on Wednesday. Schools closed just a month after reopening. Since Tang\u2019s case was announced, the city claims to have tested more than 3.5 million people.\n\nAD\n\nIn the weeks before this outbreak, Chinese officials had spoken proudly of their success in containing the coronavirus, suggesting China could be a model for others to follow. But the new cases show that model may be much more fragile than it first appeared.\n\nThe new cases in Beijing raise worrying questions \u2014 not only about how the virus could have gotten to Xinfadi market, which is the obvious concern, but also about whether livestock or even fish carry the virus. Chinese officials said the virus could have been circulating near the market since April.\n\nAD\n\nOne thing is painfully clear: This pandemic is far from over.\n\nBeijing is battling a second wave, but other nations are not yet over their first. And as China takes its wartime approach to fighting the coronavirus, some nations are retreating. Amid fatigue, uncertainty and economic pain, they have fallen back, choosing to surrender rather than sacrifice.\n\nAD\n\nIn the United States, Vice President Pence wrote in the Wall Street Journal\u2019s opinion section this week that the media got it wrong: The United States was not facing a second wave of infections, it was \u201cwinning the fight against the invisible enemy.\u201d\n\nNumerous experts, including Anthony S. Fauci, America\u2019s top infectious-disease official, contradict that assessment. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about a second wave right now, because we haven\u2019t gotten out of our first wave,\u201d Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Daily Beast.\n\nAD\n\nAs businesses across the country reopen, numerous states are seeing new peaks in their outbreaks, along with daily totals that dwarf the cases found in Beijing\u2019s outbreak. None, however, are restricting travel or locking down neighborhoods in the same way.\n\nAD\n\nBeijing has canceled 1200 flights over just 130 recently discovered cases. https://t.co/OqysB5hpFt\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, here's the latest look at Arizona, Texas, and Florida. pic.twitter.com/dkrvCumkp4 \u2014 Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) June 17, 2020\n\nGlobally, the numbers show that the pandemic is surging even as the world tries to move on. The United States is one hot spot, as are other big nations such as Russia and India. In Brazil, which has had the world\u2019s highest number of daily confirmed cases since late May, President Jair Bolsonaro and other officials ignored lockdown warnings.\n\n\u201cWe are doing something that no one else has done,\u201d Pedro Hallal, an epidemiologist at the Federal University of Pelotas, told The Washington Post. \u201cWe\u2019re getting near the curve\u2019s peak, and it\u2019s like we are almost challenging the virus. \u2018Let\u2019s see how many people you can infect. We want to see how strong you are.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOther countries that were initially more confident are now watching their good fortune turn. Even as Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi touted his country\u2019s success and condemned critics of his coronavirus strategy, doctors are warning that a surge in cases is overwhelming the system.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEven the smallest pressure can make the Egyptian health system collapse,\u201d a doctor in her 20s who works at one of Cairo\u2019s premier educational hospitals said in an interview with The Post.\n\nBeijing\u2019s outbreak shows that even when the virus recedes, there can be no return to normality. The speed at which the coronavirus can spread \u2014 as well as the lingering uncertainties about how it spreads, who it kills and why \u2014 means heightened vigilance will remain a necessity.\n\nThere have been other worrying signs from other nations. Singapore and South Korea, which both appeared to have battered back the first wave of the outbreak, have had worrying flare-ups that led them to reimpose some restrictions. New Zealand, which announced it was coronavirus-free on June 8, saw the virus return via travelers from Britain.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome officials openly admit that we will be playing a game of cat and mouse with coronavirus clusters for months, if not years.\n\n\u201cI personally believe that over the next year or several years, this virus will take root in our society,\u201d Hitoshi Oshitani, a Japanese virologist and government adviser, said in a recent interview, adding that he doubted a vaccine would be effective and that a strategy of waiting for herd immunity was \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\nAny new outbreak \u2014 especially a new outbreak where the chain of transmission cannot be ascertained \u2014 is particularly worrying in China, a high-tech, authoritarian state that had staked so much on fighting back the first wave of infections in spring.\n\nAD\n\nMr Tang of Xicheng, the first person who sought medical attention in the Xinfadi outbreak, is praised for his sense of responsibility & thoughtfulness as the scale of the outbreak is being revealed.
